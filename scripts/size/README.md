Some scripts to estimate the number of base pairs for regular and spherical n-gon bipyramids from a given outer diameter, or vice versa.
Caveats:
- The diameter is that of the circle whose centre is equal to the centre of the n-gon, and whose circumfrence intersects all vertices of the n-gon;
- The total height of the bipyramid is assumed to be the same as the diameter;
- The calculations does not account for the width of the helixes.
